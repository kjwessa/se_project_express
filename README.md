# WTWR (What to Wear?): Server Side Development

This project is aimed at designing and implementing the server component of my React WTWR application. The project served to deepen my understanding of working with databases, performing testing, and deploying applications to a remote server. Eventually, the target is to establish a server complete with an API and user authentication mechanism.

## Capabilities

The project serves as the server-side element of the WTWR application. It involves setting up an API, designing the URL paths, and building and configuring a database utilizing MongoDB.

## Technologies and Methods

Controllers were set up as the endpoint for a series of request handlers. Models were employed to encapsulate the schemas. In addition, routes were designed to manage the delivery of webpages and the reception of data from users. Through efficient compartmentalization, the code was structured in a way that facilitated effortless debugging. MongoDB was employed as the database solution, while Express.js facilitated the creation and alteration of data to be sent to and received from the database.
